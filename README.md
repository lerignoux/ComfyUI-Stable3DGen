Hi3DGen target at generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images using normal maps as an intermediate representation. The framework addresses limitations in existing methods that struggle to reproduce fine-grained geometric details from 2D inputs.

## News
**[April 13, 2025]** 🚀 Hi3DGen v0.1 Released! 🔥🔥🔥 Hi3DGen-MV is still under training, we expect to release it by April 20th. Model Offloading for compatible 8 GB GPU memory is expected by April 17th.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Stable-X/Hi3DGen.git
cd Hi3DGen
```

Create a conda environment (optional):
```bash
conda create -n stablex python=3.10
conda activate stablex
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
